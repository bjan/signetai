-- Migration 027: Backfill NULL canonical_name on entities
--
-- Migration 005 added the canonical_name column but never backfilled
-- existing rows, leaving them NULL. This causes the upsertEntity
-- lookup (which queries by canonical_name) to miss existing entities,
-- leading to UNIQUE constraint violations on the name column during
-- skill reconciliation and extraction.

-- Match toCanonicalName(): trim, lowercase, collapse internal whitespace.
-- SQLite lacks regex replace, so iteratively collapse double-spaces
-- (covers the realistic cases; triple+ spaces converge after a few passes).
UPDATE entities
SET canonical_name = REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(
    LOWER(TRIM(name)),
    '  ', ' '), '  ', ' '), '  ', ' ')
WHERE canonical_name IS NULL;
