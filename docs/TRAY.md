# Desktop Tray

The consumer desktop distribution for Signet is the Electron app in
`surfaces/desktop`. It owns the native window, menu bar tray, bundled Bun
runtime, and daemon process lifecycle for desktop installs.

`surfaces/tray` is intentionally small. It contains shared tray/menu state
utilities only. It is not a desktop shell and contains no legacy native-shell code.

## Runtime model

On startup, the Electron app probes the configured daemon port
(`SIGNET_PORT`, default `3850`). If a daemon is already running, the app
attaches to it. If not, it starts the bundled Bun daemon from the packaged
resources and marks that daemon as desktop-owned.

The daemon remains a separate local process. The desktop app is a
distribution and control layer, not a replacement for the daemon.

## User-facing behavior

The Electron desktop app provides:

- native tray/menu bar status
- daemon start, stop, and restart actions
- hide-to-tray behavior when the main window closes
- dashboard launch/focus
- quick memory capture
- memory search
- bundled daemon fallback for consumer installs

The dashboard is still the same web dashboard served by the daemon. Browser
usage and desktop usage share the dashboard codepath.

## Development

```bash
bun run build:desktop
```

For focused desktop work:

```bash
cd surfaces/desktop
bun run build:desktop
bun run dev
```

The desktop build stages:

1. the shared tray utilities
2. the Bun daemon and dashboard bundle
3. a platform Bun runtime
4. Electron packaging artifacts

Generated desktop resources live under `surfaces/desktop/resources/` and are
not committed.

## Release artifacts

The desktop workflow builds Electron artifacts for:

| Platform | Artifact |
|---|---|
| Linux | `.AppImage` and `.deb` |
| macOS | `.dmg` |
| Windows | installer `.exe` |
| Arch | AppImage-backed AUR metadata |

AUR metadata is generated from the release AppImage URL and checksum by
`deploy/aur/generate-pkgbuild.sh`.
