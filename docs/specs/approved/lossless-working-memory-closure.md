# Lossless Working Memory Closure

## Why this exists

The base temporal-head and working-memory runtime specs establish the
architecture, but they still leave room for partial implementations that
technically point in the right direction while missing critical operator
surfaces.

This closure spec makes the missing pieces mandatory. The intended user
experience is not "roughly LCM-shaped." It is a complete working system.

## Strict Adherence Contract (Non-negotiable)

Everything in this document is a MUST-level contract, not guidance.

Any implementation that fails one of these requirements is non-compliant.
There is no "partial credit" version where `MEMORY.md` is useful only for
coding flows or only for single-thread sessions.

The system must hold up for mixed days with many active people, topics,
projects, and concurrent conversations.

## Three-Tier Universal Memory Contract

The runtime must implement all three tiers at once.

### Tier 1: Global Head (always injected)

`MEMORY.md` is the active head and must stay concise, high-signal, and
immediately actionable.

It must include:

- highest-priority active state across threads
- commitments, blockers, and next actions
- durable constraints and safety boundaries
- references to deeper lineage nodes

It must not become an unbounded transcript dump.

### Tier 2: Thread Heads (rolling, scoped summaries)

The runtime must maintain rolling summaries per active thread so work does
not collapse into one monolithic narrative.

A thread can be any durable context stream, including person, project,
topic, or mixed conversational lane.

Each thread head must carry:

- current status
- decisions already made
- unresolved open loops
- next action
- references to temporal lineage

### Tier 3: Lossless Lineage Substrate (deep history)

Transcripts, session summaries, compaction artifacts, and condensed DAG
nodes form the lossless substrate.

Tier 3 is complete history, not the default prompt surface.

Tier 1 and Tier 2 are rendered views over Tier 3 plus structured
distillation outputs.

## Hard Requirements

### 1. Temporal drill-down is mandatory

`MEMORY.md` may stay concise, but it must not strand the agent at the
surface layer.

The runtime must expose a temporal expansion path that accepts a temporal
node id and returns:

- the selected node
- parent lineage
- child lineage
- sibling and thread-local context when available
- linked memory rows when they exist
- transcript context when it exists for that lineage

This surface may be exposed through API, MCP, or both, but the contract
must exist and the returned shape must preserve `agent_id` scoping.

### 2. Merge-safe head writes are mandatory

Same-agent concurrent writers must not silently clobber `MEMORY.md`.

The runtime must provide:

- a shared head record or equivalent lock target
- active lease / ownership metadata
- refusal on active conflicts rather than blind overwrite
- retry-safe behavior so a temporary busy head does not suppress the
  next valid synthesis attempt

A busy write is not a terminal failure. It is a deferred write.

Temporal scoping must be just as strict for storage keys:

- transcript persistence must be unique by `agent_id + session_key`
- summary retry uniqueness must be unique by `agent_id + session_key`
- no temporal write path may assume `session_key` is globally unique

The same merge safety requirement applies to thread heads and any
thread-index metadata used to build Tier 2.

### 3. Compaction is part of the same memory system

Compaction artifacts are not auxiliary notes and are not allowed to fork
into a separate continuity path.

Hard requirements:

- compaction output is stored as a first-class temporal node
- compaction nodes can coexist beside session summary nodes for the same
  session lineage
- temporal condensation may consume summary and compaction roots alike
- prompt dedup / continuity bookkeeping resets correctly after
  compaction so stale injected context can be reconsidered
- Tier 1 and affected Tier 2 thread heads are refreshed after compaction
  completes, using the same DAG lineage

### 4. Transcript fallback stays secondary

Structured distillation remains the primary retrieval surface.

Transcript retrieval is required, but only as:

- a fallback when structured traversal has not caught up yet
- a deep-history substrate when transcript-specific lookup is needed
- an expansion substrate when drilling through temporal lineage

Transcript searchability and embeddability are required capabilities,
not justification for promoting transcripts to the default prompt-time
source of truth.

Default retrieval order must remain:

1. structured distillation surfaces
2. thread heads and temporal summaries
3. transcript fallback and deep-history lookup

### 5. Harness fidelity must be explicit

Every harness must map to the same ideal runtime model, and the docs must
say exactly where fidelity is full versus degraded.

The compatibility contract must explicitly state:

- which lifecycle hooks each harness supports
- whether live prompt-submit transcript capture exists
- whether pre-compaction exists
- whether post-compaction exists
- what degraded behavior applies when a hook surface is unavailable

No docs may overclaim full lifecycle parity when the runtime does not yet
wire the required hook events.

### 6. Thread scoping and anti-bleed are mandatory

Generalized usage requires strict separation between concurrently active
threads.

Hard requirements:

- each thread head has a stable scoped key
- retrieval and refresh logic respect `agent_id` plus thread scope
- unrelated thread context is not injected by default
- cross-thread linkage is allowed only when explicit relevance signals
  exist

This prevents context bleed between unrelated topics and people.

### 7. Freshness cadence is mandatory

To keep continuity deterministic:

- Tier 1 refreshes on session end and compaction completion
- Tier 2 refreshes for affected threads on the same events
- Tier 3 transcript writes happen during active prompt flow whenever
  harness hooks allow it

When a harness cannot provide one event type, degraded behavior must be
explicitly documented.

## Required Harness Outcomes

### OpenCode

Reference full-fidelity path:

- session-start
- user-prompt-submit
- pre-compaction
- compaction-complete
- session-end

### OpenClaw plugin path

Must support the full temporal model as the flagship harness:

- prompt-time continuity
- pre-compaction capture
- post-compaction artifact persistence
- session-end continuity
- compatibility with the same shared `MEMORY.md` head as other harnesses

### Claude Code

Allowed degraded mode:

- session-start
- user-prompt-submit
- pre-compaction
- session-end

If no post-compaction event exists, docs must say so explicitly.

### Codex

Allowed degraded mode:

- session-start
- user-prompt-submit
- session-end

If no compaction lifecycle hooks exist, docs must say so explicitly.

### OpenClaw legacy path

Compatibility-only mode:

- manual context/remember/recall may remain available
- it is not considered full lossless-working-memory parity

## Documentation Requirements

The following documents must stay aligned with the shipped runtime:

- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/HOOKS.md`
- `docs/HARNESSES.md`
- `docs/specs/INDEX.md`
- `docs/specs/dependencies.yaml`

Required documentation coverage:

- transcript fallback is secondary, not primary
- `MEMORY.md` is the merge-safe temporal head
- three-tier model (global head, thread heads, lineage substrate) is a
  strict contract
- temporal drill-down surfaces are documented
- harness fidelity matrix is documented
- compaction parity and degraded modes are documented
- thread scoping, anti-bleed behavior, and freshness cadence are
  documented

## Rust Parity Requirement

This closure spec does not require full daemon-rs cutover. For closure-wave
changes, request/response contract changes must be mirrored in daemon-rs
in the same PR, while deeper runtime behavior parity can land in the
follow-up parity wave tracked under rust cutover specs.

Minimum contract:

- request/response shape changes are mirrored into `platform/daemon-rs/`
  in the same PR
- touched endpoints keep parity guard coverage so divergences are visible
- behavior deltas that cannot be mirrored in-wave are explicitly documented
  in `docs/HARNESSES.md` degraded-mode notes

Broader runtime parity completion remains tracked by the separate parity and
cutover specs.
